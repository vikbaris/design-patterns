# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

## Overview
The Abstract Factory design pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This pattern is particularly useful when the system needs to be independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

## Implementation Details
This project demonstrates the Abstract Factory pattern by simulating a cross-platform UI component system. It includes interfaces for different document components (Header, Content, Footer) and concrete implementations for PDF and HTML formats.

### Key Components
- **Interfaces**: Define the contract for document components and factories.
  - `Header`, `Content`, `Footer`: Interfaces for document components.
  - `DocumentFactory`: Interface for creating document components.

- **Concrete Implementations**: Provide specific implementations for PDF and HTML formats.
  - PDF Components: `PDFHeader`, `PDFContent`, `PDFFooter`
  - HTML Components: `HTMLHeader`, `HTMLContent`, `HTMLFooter`
  - Factories: `PDFDocumentFactory`, `HTMLDocumentFactory`

- **Client**: Uses the abstract factory to generate reports with different formats.
  - `ReportGenerator`: Generates reports using the provided factory.
  - `AbstractFactoryDemo`: Demonstrates the creation of PDF and HTML reports.

## Design Principles
- **Encapsulation of Object Creation**: The pattern encapsulates the creation of related objects, allowing the system to be independent of their concrete classes.
- **Separation of Concerns**: By separating the interface from the implementation, it promotes a clean separation of concerns, making the system easier to maintain and extend.
- **Flexibility and Extensibility**: New product families can be added without modifying existing code, enhancing the flexibility and extensibility of the system.

## Usage
The `AbstractFactoryDemo` class contains a `main` method that demonstrates how to use the Abstract Factory pattern to create and render UI components for different platforms (PDF and HTML).

## Conclusion
The Abstract Factory pattern is a powerful tool for managing the complexity of creating families of related objects. It promotes loose coupling and enhances the scalability and maintainability of the system.
